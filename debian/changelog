libgd-gd2-perl (2.070-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Tighten build-dependency on libgd2 (required by new features in this
    release).
  * All tests succeed now compiled against libgd2 2.0.12, which closes:
    Bug#191888 (thanks to Daniel Schepler <schepler@math.berkeley.edu>).
  * Use new command-line options instead of patching Makefile.PL.
  * Use debhelper v4. Tighten build-dependency, switch debhelper hint
    from DH_COMPAT to debian/compat, and include ${misc:Depends}.

    allow building on woody.
