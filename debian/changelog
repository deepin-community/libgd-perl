libgd-gd2-perl (2.041-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Remove free -> gd_free patch now corrected upstream.
  * Enable all tests (except test 8, probably failing because of
    Debian-specific FreeType patches) again - tests corrected/updated
    upstream.
  * Tighten build-depends on libgd2-xpm-dev to at least 2.0.4-4 (which
    has a proper shlibs file and correct dependencies).
  * Add watch file.
  * Change build-depends to only the virtual libz-dev and libpng12-dev
    (not their real counterparts as well).
  * Tighten build-dependencies on perl and debhelper.
  * Rewrite debian/rules inspired by newer dh-make-perl template:
    + Credit where credit is due.
    + Use debhelper v3
    + Support DESTDIR and DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS debug.
    + Separate install target.
    + Remove unnecessary debhelper calls.
  * Remove virtual package libgd-perl (now provided as a transitional
    package by source-package libgd-perl (>= 1.41-3)).
  * Mention in description that this package is built with Xpm support.
  * Conflict on all other libgd-*-perl variants.
